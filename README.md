# Adams-Bashforth-method

4th-order Adams-Bashforth method for linear first- and second-order differential equations.  

The initial values \(y_1, y_2, y_3\) should be computed using a **4th-order Runge-Kutta method (Ralston’s formula)**. Exact coefficient values need to be looked up independently.
